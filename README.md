## Introduction

TikTok has become a popular platform for sharing short videos on various topics. Understanding the sentiment behind these videos can provide insights into user opinions and trends. This project conducts sentiment analysis on TikTok video data to identify and visualize the predominant emotions expressed. This analysis was performed as part of my university project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes TikTok video data with columns for `score` and `sentiment`. The `score` represents a numerical value assigned to the video, and `sentiment` indicates the emotional tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
